                  Use `//` notation for LutaML comments skipped by parser,
                  example:
          - type: paragraph
          - type: code_block
            content:
              - type: text
                text: |-
                  // TODO: implement

                  class Pet {}

            content:
              - type: text

                  Use `\**`(one line comment) or `*| |*`(multiline comment) to
                  create comment object for diagram entry. If this syntax used
                  inside class/enum/association block it will be created for
                  owner of this block.
