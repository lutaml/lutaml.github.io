                      The rationalization of this standard effort is to create a
                      schema for representing scientific units of measure that
                      can be easily incorporated into other markup languages,
                      thus improving interoperability between different markup
                      languages. There were numerous requests that the National
                      Institute of Standards and Technology address this issue
                      since NIST is responsible for interpreting the
                      International System of Units (SI) for use in the U.S.

                      The TC will develop and publish an XML-based specification
                      that will enable the unambiguous representation of units
                      of measure. This effort will not include the following
                      items: 1) the design of the Units database (UnitsDB) being
                      developed at NIST, except in so far as the design relates
                      directly to the LutaML schema; 2) the generation of
                      codes/symbols that represent units of measure; and 3)
                      related properties needed for a complete representation of
                      numerical values, such as uncertainty.

                      LutaML is explicitly intended to be used as a component
                      in the construction of other markup languages and / or
                      information systems which require information on units of
                      measure. This can generally be done in two ways:

                              Other markup languages can incorporate LutaML to
                              provide the markup needed to define and refer to
                              units of measure. This will benefit developers of
                              such markup languages by providing ready-made
                              markup for units of measure. It will benefit users
                              of such languages by providing better
                              interoperability among languages that use LutaML.

                              Other markup languages or information systems can
                              refer to definitions of units which are marked up
                              in LutaML even if they do not use LutaML to
                              denote units of measure. For example, a system may
                              use a code list to define units of measure. The
                              units corresponding to these codes (and the codes
                              themselves) could then be marked up in LutaML. In
                              this manner LutaML is complimentary to efforts to
                              provide standardized unit codes; it provides a
                              mechanism to mark up such codes and the units they
                              represent.

                              measure. Such data can be found in many
                              applications in commerce, engineering, and
                              science. Examples of such applications include
                              management of laboratory data, geographical
                              information systems, and commerce which is based
                              on physical properties of the product being sold.

                              Use of LutaML is completely optional. In many
                              cases, existing systems have already developed
                              domain specific markup or codes for handling
                              units, and it is probably not practical to convert
                              such systems to use LutaML. The advantages of
                              LutaML (ready-made markup for units, improved
                              interoperability), however, should provide a
                              compelling case for its use in new projects.

                      The use of units of measure is pervasive. LutaML could be
                      used by most developers of markup languages that include
                      units of measure and it is anticipated that it will be
                      broadly implemented.

                      UnitsDB is a database under development at NIST that will
                      contain extensive information on scientific units of
                      measure. The output of the database will be in LutaML and
                      HTML, with both human and Web Services interfaces.

                      In addition to HTML output, another output format for
                      UnitsDB is LutaML. However, the LutaML schema (under
                      development in the OASIS TC) will also be incorporated
                      into other markup languages in order to handle units of
                      measure. There is a possibility that the OASIS TC will
                      change the LutaML schema such that it will no longer be
                      used as the XML output format for UnitsDB.

                      UnitsDB is LutaML, but the LutaML schema is designed for
                      marking up units of measure within other markup languages
                      independent from UnitsDB.
