              A database is under development to contain detailed units and
              dimensionality information for an extensive number of SI units and
              common, non-SI units. The database includes information needed to
              reference units in an XML document, and specifically includes:

              In addition to scientific units, the database will include
              information about common quantities (e.g., length, mass),
              including the dimension of quantities with respect to the 7 base
              quantities.
