= Annotations

== Entity or attributes annotations can be declared with "definition" keyword:

Example of class annotation:

```
class AddressClassProfile {
  definition {
    this is multiline with `ascidoc`
    comments
    and list
    \{foo\} \{name\}
  }
  +addressClassProfile: CharacterString [0..1]
}
```

Attribute annotation example:

```
class AttributeProfile {
  imlicistAttributeProfile: CharacterString [0..1] {
    definition {
      this is attribute definition
      with multiply lines
      \{foo\} \{name\}
      end definition
    }
  }
}
```
