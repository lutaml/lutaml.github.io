= Associations

Lutaml supports different types of associations: `composition`, `aggregation`, `generalization`, `inheritance`, `direct`. Lutaml uses association blocks in order to declare associations. Syntax:

```
association name {
 owned_type association|composition|aggregation|generalization|uses

 member_type association|composition|aggregation|generalization|uses

 owned association_name[#attribute_name] [{property_string}][cardinality]

 member association_name[#attribute_name] [{property_string}][cardinality]
}
```

where:

`owned_type` - optional, use to define bidirectional association(association|composition|aggregation|generalization|uses)

`member_type` - association type(association|composition|aggregation|generalization|uses)

`owned|member` - end of association, use `\#attribute_name` to set a role name

`property_string` - property string for attibutes associations

`cardinality` - examples: '1..\*', '\*'
