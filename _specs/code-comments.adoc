= Code comments

Use `//` notation for LutaML comments skipped by parser, example:

```
// TODO: implement
class Pet {}
```

Use `\**`(one line comment) or `*| |*`(multiline comment) to create comment object for diagram entry. If this syntax used inside class/enum/association block it will be created for owner of this block.

```
** I am a document comment

*|

 This is a

 multiply

 lines document comment.

*|

class A

enum B {

 ** one line enum comment

 foo

*|

 This is a

 multiply

 lines class comment.

 *|

 bar

}
```
